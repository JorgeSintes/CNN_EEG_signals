# A Simplified CNN Classification Method for MI-EEG via the Electrode Pairs Signals
This is a simple implementation of a CNN for classifying ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals, meant to replicate the results obtained in the paper of the same name by X. Lun et al.

This is part of a special-course for the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Computation, where this model will serve as a baseline to compare against other Bayesian ML methods (Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes). The purpose of the project is to test the models, hopefully improving the results shown by other state-of-the-art techniques for classification of EEG signals, for Brain Imagery applications.
