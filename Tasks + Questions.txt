Tasks:

- Take off-the-shelf linear model to make the classification and have it as a form of baseline

- Finish implementing paper

- If time permits it: look into bayesian approaches

Questions for Michael:

- Check if batch norm is performed correctly


Hypotheses for overfitting:
 - Dropout not deactivated in eval mode -> should be covered with model.eval() - try also setting inplace=False in dropouts (just in case)
 - Too small batchsize
 - Data loading could be done incorrectly?
 - Could be that there's class imbalance between train and test
 - Keep 21 classes
